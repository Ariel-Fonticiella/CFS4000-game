<h2>Context</h2>

<hr />

Cat Fighter Simulator 4000 was the very first project I ever worked on. I completed this game in the span of about 2 weeks while I attended IronHack.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>


This game was hands-down one of the funnest projects I got to work on. Mostly, because I was given the opportunity to combine many of the things I love: video-games, coding, and creating original content. Most of this game was inspired by my childhood. Now, when I say "by my childhood" I'm not saying that fighting cats was my thing, really what I mean is that it's inspired by the 90s era. Much of this game references things I enjoyed while growing up in the 90s, along with some fairly recent references as well.

My goal while creating this game was to take your average vertical-scrolling shooter game and inject it with content that would keep you entertained with humor, even though the game itself wasn't very complex. On a side not, all the content for this game was written by myself, for your enjoyment! To try the game, you can click the link below.
