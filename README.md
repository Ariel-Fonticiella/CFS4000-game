<h2>Context</h2>
Cat Fighter Simulator 4000 was the very first project I ever worked on. I completed this game in the span of about 2 weeks while I attended IronHack.


<h2>Inspiration</h2>


This game was hands-down one of the funnest projects I got to work on. Mostly, because I was given the opportunity to combine many of the things I love: video-games, coding, and creating content. Most of this game was inspired by my childhood. Now, I'm not saying that fighting cats was my thing, really what I mean is that it's inspired by the 90s era. Much of this game references things I enjoyed while growing up in the 90s, along with some fairly recent references as well.
